            <p>Online time tools is a collection of useful browser-based time and date calculation utilities. All time tools are simple, free and easy to use. There are no ads, popups or other garbage, just time utilities that work right in your browser. And all utilities work exactly the same way and have the same user interface.
                a friendly and fun cross-browser testing company powered by alien technology. At Browserling our mission is to make developers' lives easier, so we created this collection of online time and date tools. Unlike many other tools, we made our tools free, without ads, and with the simplest possible user interface.
                All conversions and calculations are done in your browser using JavaScript. We don't send a single bit about your input data to our servers. There is no server-side processing at all. We use Google Analytics and StatCounter for site usage analytics. Your IP address is saved on our web server, but it's not associated with any personally identifiable information. We don't use cookies and don't store session information in cookies. We use your browser's local storage to save tools' input. It stays on your computer.
